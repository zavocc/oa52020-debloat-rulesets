# OPPO A5 2020 Debloat Configuration Scripts
A set of scripts and list of packages to debloat for OPPO A5 2020/ColorOS 11 (CPH1933_11_F.16)

This repository contains a list (right now PowerShell arrays) of ColorOS packages that can be safely removed with levels of how many packages to be uninstalled exchanging privacy, convinence, and embracing alternatives to lackluster of features and broken functionality in system apps.

There are three levels and sublevels of packages that can be uninstalled (Basic, Intermediate (w/ Google Apps), Hardcore (w/ Google Apps))

Note that this is more of a subjective configuration that tailors my needs and for some people than a general recommendation but Trial and Errors, Research, and Recommendation from Universal Android Debloater I was able to list of packages that isn't essential or even required to show up in home screen and run itself in the background. This may change anytime.
